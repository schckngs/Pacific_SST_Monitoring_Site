    "text": "Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, or deviations above or below the “normal” conditions, are important to monitor over time. Variations that happen for an extended period of time, or are large in magnitude, may have very large impacts on the larger ecosystem. Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are a topic of growing concern, as large-scale heat events can negatively affect the life cycles, food availability, and habitat of so many species that live in our oceans. MHWs are typically defined as temperatures above the upper 90th percentile of what is typical for a given area (see Hobday et al. (2016) and Hobday et al. (2018) for further reading about commonly used definitions). On the other hand, Marine cold spells (MCSs), are periods where temperatures are cooler than the lower 10th percentile typically observed in a location, and may also have both positive and negative effects on ecosystems."
